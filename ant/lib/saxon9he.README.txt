==============================

Saxon-HE 9.5 is the latest major release of the open-source edition of Saxon. 
It is available for both the Java and .NET platforms.

The current maintenance release is Saxon-HE 9.5.1.3.

The documentation for Saxon is at http://www.saxonica.com/documentation/
and includes a detailed list of changes for each release.

For the Java platform, download file SaxonHE9-5-1-3J.zip. Installation instructions are at:

http://www.saxonica.com/documentation9.5/index.html#!about/installationjava

For the .NET platform, download file SaxonHE9-5-1-3N-setup.exe. 
Installation instructions are at:

http://www.saxonica.com/documentation9.5/index.html#!about/installationdotnet

The file saxon-resources9-5.zip contains documentation, sample files, test drivers and other miscellaneous resources. 
It is common to both platforms, and is not normally updated when new maintenance releases appear.

The file saxon9-5-1-3source.zip contains source code for both platforms; a new version is produced with each 
maintenance release. Source code with the latest patches can also be obtained from a Subversion repository
maintained at http://dev.saxonica.com/archive/opensource. The Subversion repository on the SourceForge
site is no longer maintained.
